Teachers are discovering that no matter how much novelty there is in
their entertainment, how well it is arranged, how thoroughly drilled,
if they want to hold the active interest of the audience they must use
the best of songs. The songs must be real novelties. The words must be
interesting as well as decidedly clever. The music must be catchy and
abounding in rich melody. With these things in mind we have prepared
this list of superior song novelties for our patrons. All are in
regular sheet music form.

WELCOME SONGS

  We’ve Just Arrived from Bashful Town.
  We Hope You’ve Brought Your Smiles Along.
  Come and Partake of Our Welcome Cake.
  We’re Very Glad to See You Here.
  With Quaking Hearts We Welcome You.


CLOSING SONGS

  Mr. Sun and Mrs. Moon.
  Now, Aren’t You Glad You Came?
  We Do Not Like to Say Goodbye.
  We’ll Now Have to Say Goodbye.

A Thanksgiving Dream


  JACK:
  I had the grandest dinner—
    Pudding and cake and pie—
  Turkey and mashed potato
    Ice cream—it makes me sigh
  To think that anything was left
    Of all that dandy meal,
  But I couldn’t eat another bite
    So very full I feel.
  I guess I’ll take a nap till supper time.
  [_Yawns, stretches, lies down and sleeps._]

  _Enter_ PILGRIM MAIDS.

  ALL:
  We’re Pilgrim Maids of long ago
    When all this world was new,
  And stories of that far off time
    We shall relate to you.

  FIRST:
  Our fathers came from England here
    Across the stormy sea,
  And many hardships they endured
    To gain their liberty.

  SECOND:
  The Indians were our trusty friends
    And taught us many things—
  To plow—to plant—to fish—to hunt—
    And what each season brings.

  THIRD:
  A harvest bountiful we gleaned
    In 1622
  And called the Indians to a feast.
    Such fun you never knew.
  This was the first Thanksgiving Day—
    A day of earnest praise
  For peace and plenty granted us
    After our weary days.

  FOURTH:
  When I was a little, little girl
    My parents went away
  And left me to mind the babies.
    An Indian came that day
  And I pushed the frightened babies
    Who were playing on the floor
  Under two big brass kettles.
    They both began to roar.
  It scared the Indians very much
    When he saw the kettles run
  And he loudly roared “Kettles alive!”
    And threw away his gun.
  I shot him as he ran away,
    They found him just outside.
  I kept the kettles many years
    And told the tale with pride.

  FIFTH:
  My sister and I scared the Indians away
    One night many long years ago
  By changing some pumpkins to Jack-Lanterns bright
    And waving them to and fro.
  In the darkness they thought they were ghosts
    And yelling in fright and alarm
  They fled to the forest as fast as they could—
    So our Jack-Lanterns saved us from harm.

  _Enter_ INDIANS.

  TOGETHER:
  I’m Massoit.
  I’m Samoset.

  FIRST:
  The first Thanksgiving Day
    We feasted with the Pilgrim folks
  And jolly games did play.

  SECOND:
  We brought them turkeys, oysters, deer,
    And stayed to eat them all,
  And Elder Brewster said we’d have
    Thanksgiving Day each fall.

  _Enter_ PUMPKINS.

  ALL:
  We’re the pumpkins your family made into pies
  And we really must say that a boy of your size
  Ought to be so ashamed of himself—for you ate
  Till there wasn’t a piece of pie left on the plate.
  We hope you have a stomach ache—an awful stomach ache.

  _Enter_ TURKEYS.

  ALL:
  Gobble, gobble, gobble,
    Turkeys sad are we.
  This glad Thanksgiving season
    Does not with us agree.

  FIRST:
  Boys talk about Thanksgiving and make an awful fuss—
    The feast that is so fine for them is always death for us.

  SECOND:
  This boy looks nice and tender, friends—he’s plump as plump can be.
    Let’s have a feast ourselves today and eat him fricassee.

  JACK:
  No-no-don’t eat me—don’t I beg—

  THIRD:
  Why not?—You find us tasty.

  JACK:
  Don’t eat me—think what that would mean,
    Oh, please don’t be so hasty.

  FOURTH:
  Don’t listen to his tale of woe—our friends all gobbled loudly.
  His father just chopped off their heads and ate them up so proudly.

  FIFTH:
  Oh, let him go. I can’t be cruel. Yes, let him go. Don’t cry.

  SECOND:
  You chicken-hearted turkeys, you’ll be sorry by and by.

  _Enter_ GOBLINS.

  ALL:
  We are the Thanksgiving Goblins.
    We’ll get you unless you take care.
  We’re after such greedy young people
    So youngster you’d better beware.
  We’ll give you such pains in your tummy
    You’ll wriggle from sunset till morn,
  We’ll pinch you and poke you and pound you—
    You’ll wish you had never been born.

  JACK:
  Please don’t hurt me.

  FIRST:
  After all that dinner he doesn’t want to be hurt.

  SECOND:
  Tell us what you ate.

  JACK:
  I didn’t eat much—just some turkey—
    A leg—and the back—and the wing—
  Potatoes and turnips and cranberry sauce,
    Ice cream, cake, pie, everything.

  THIRD GOBLIN:
  Come, brothers, let’s pinch him.

  [_They gather round_ JACK _and pinch him—he screams_.]

  MOTHER [_calling_]: JACK—JACK.

  GOBLINS _run_. JACK _awakes—rubs eyes, yawns_.

  JACK:
  I must have been sleeping—I dreamed funny things
    About goblins and turkeys, and pies,
  And Pilgrims, and Indians, and all sorts of things,
    They were right here in front of my eyes.
  I hope that my supper is ready—I’m hungry as hungry can be
    I think I dreamed that I ate too much—
  But I won’t let a dream worry me.

[_He leaves stage in answer to his mother’s calls and the_ PILGRIM
MAIDS, INDIANS, PUMPKINS, TURKEYS _and_ GOBLINS _return in the order
named, form group and sing:_]

  _Song—Air:_ OLD BLACK JOE


1.

  We’ve come to warn all the greedy girls and boys.
  Heed our advice though your feelings it annoys.
  Don’t be like Jack o’er the Gobble-uns and pies
  And turkeys, too, will soon appear before your eyes.

_Chorus:_

  Be careful—be careful—
  Listen well to what we say
  And guard your appetite this glad Thanksgiving Day.


2.

  We are but dreams, alas, ’tis all too true,
  When you awake we must vanish far from view.
  But aches and pains we will bring you while we may
  If you are greedy and devour our friends today.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
